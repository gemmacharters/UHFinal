Created as a project for Masters Degree
Web 2.0 Application. For Concept Art students to create and maintain a portfolio of work, for study and as a showcase of work.
Created using Visual Studio 2017, with C# and ASP.NET
There is a video that was created to demonstrate the application to the university staff for marking.
There is a SQL Server backup file for the database. The code was developed in a different repository which was registered using the Universitiy's email, but as I have now completed the course I do not have access.
The application can work on a local machine if you download the source code into VS, restore the database from backup and edit the config file with the local connectionstring.
